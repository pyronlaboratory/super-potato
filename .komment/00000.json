        "description": "a game of minesweeper and solves it using a recursive backtracker algorithm. It uses the `Grid` class from the `java.util.Arrays` package to represent the game grid as an array of integers, where each integer represents a cell on the grid with a value of either 0 (empty) or -1 (mine). The code defines several methods for solving the game, including `solve()` which takes in the row and column of a given cell and returns true if the cell is mineswept and false otherwise. It also includes a `printResult()` method to print out the final state of the grid after the game has been solved. Overall, the code provides an efficient solution for solving the classic game of minesweeper using a backtracker algorithm.",

            "description": "Is a solver for the classic Sudoku puzzle game. It takes in a 2D grid and finds a solution to the game by iterating over neighboring cells of a given cell and increasing the value of that cell if the combined values of the two cells don't exceed the total value. The class also provides methods for counting the number of non-zero cells on the same row and column as a given cell, checking if a cell has no alive neighbors, and printing the final solution to the grid.",
